- **Proof of Learning** - Cryptographic evidence of what your AI learned from
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in** - No API fees, no service shutdowns, no data hostage
- **Censorship Resistant** - Your knowledge can't be deleted or restricted

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Windows)

### Prerequisites
1. **Kinic Account** - [Sign up free at kinic.io](https://kinic.io)
2. **Chrome Browser** with [Kinic extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kinic/mnddmednohmjdgmpbaieolebflkbcbjc) installed
3. **Windows 10/11** with Python 3.8+

### Step 1: Get the Code
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/hshadab/kinic-api.git
cd kinic-api
```

### Step 2: Install Python (if needed)
```powershell
# Check if Python is installed
python --version

# If not installed, use winget:
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements
```powershell
pip install flask flask-cors pyautogui pyperclip requests
```

### Step 4: Capture Kinic Button Position
```powershell
python capture-mouse-windows.py
```
Position your mouse over the Kinic extension icon when prompted and wait for countdown.

### Step 5: Capture AI Response Position
```powershell
python capture-ai-windows.py
```
1. Open Kinic and do a search
2. Click the AI button
3. When AI text appears, position mouse in CENTER of text
4. Press Enter to capture

### Step 6: Start the API
```powershell
python kinic-api.py
```

That's it! The API is now running at `http://localhost:5006`

## ‚úÖ Test AI Extraction

```powershell
python test-ai-extraction-simple.py
```

You should see the AI-generated text extracted successfully!

## üì° API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | API status and configuration |
| `/save` | POST | Save current page to Kinic |
| `/search-and-retrieve` | POST | Search and get first URL |
| `/search-ai-extract` | POST | Search with AI analysis extraction |
| `/click` | POST | Open Kinic extension |
| `/close` | POST | Close Kinic extension |
| `/setup-kinic` | POST | Update Kinic button position |
| `/setup-ai` | POST | Update AI response position |

## üí¨ How to Use with Your AI

### With Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor
Just tell your AI:
```
"I have Kinic API running on localhost:5006. 
Save this webpage to my memory."

"Search my Kinic memory for that Python webscraping tutorial 
I saved last week and show me the code."
```

Your AI will handle the technical details!

### Quick Examples

**Save the current page:**
```python
import requests
requests.post('http://localhost:5006/save')
```

**Search and get URL:**
```python
result = requests.post('http://localhost:5006/search-and-retrieve', 
    json={'query': 'machine learning'})
print(result.json()['url'])
```

**Get AI analysis of saved content:**
```python
result = requests.post('http://localhost:5006/search-ai-extract', 
    json={'query': 'explain that Docker article I saved'})
print(result.json()['ai_response'])
# Returns actual AI-generated insights about your saved content!
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**"Python not found"**
- Install Python: `winget install Python.Python.3.12`

**"Kinic button not clicking"**
- Re-run `python capture-mouse-windows.py` and hover over the Kinic icon

**"AI extraction returning empty"**
- Make sure to position mouse in CENTER of AI text when capturing
- Re-run `python capture-ai-windows.py`

**"Running from WSL?"**
- Use PowerShell instead - WSL has coordinate translation issues
- Or run directly: `python kinic-api.py` from PowerShell

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Chrome browser with [Kinic extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kinic/mnddmednohmjdgmpbaieolebflkbcbjc)
